                        Over the past two years, I've worked extensively with Java to 
                        develop custom plugins and modifications for Minecraft, 
                        focusing on enhancing gameplay and adding unique features. 
                        I've built plugins that introduce new mechanics, optimize server 
                        performance, and provide players with a more engaging experience. 
                        Through this work, I've gained a strong understanding of the Bukkit 
                        and Spigot APIs, tackled complex issues like event handling and 
                        asynchronous processing, and fine-tuned my problem-solving skills to 
                        meet the specific needs of server owners and the Minecraft community. 
                        Working in Java has also allowed me to gain experience in working with 
                        a team on multiple projects.

                        I've worked with C# to develop small games and applications, 
                        leveraging the power of the .NET framework to create efficient 
                        and scalable solutions. I've built games that focus on fun and 
                        interactive gameplay while refining my skills in object-oriented 
                        programming, game logic, and UI development. My experience includes 
                        working with Unity for game development, as well as using 
                        .NET technologies to create backend services and desktop applications. 
                        Through these projects, I've honed my ability to write clean, maintainable 
                        code and troubleshoot performance issues effectively.

                        I've used JavaScript primarily for web development, 
                        building dynamic and responsive websites that enhance the 
                        user experience. I've worked with both front-end and 
                        back-end technologies, utilizing frameworks like Node.js. 
                        One of my key projects includes developing this website!
                        Even here, I've applied my knowledge of web technologies, and 
                        ensured a seamless user experience. Through these projects, 
                        I've strengthened my skills in DOM manipulation and API integration.
